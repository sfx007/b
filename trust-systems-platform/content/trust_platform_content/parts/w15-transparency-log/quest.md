# Quest: Week 15 Integration

## Visual Model

![Visual Model](/visuals/w15-transparency-log.svg)



## Objective
Integrate the week’s lessons into a single working demo.

## Required constraint
- **Integrate everything from this week; prove it under load/failure.**

## Prove it
Attach evidence for: `week-15/quest-report.md`  
Minimum evidence:
- a short run log (start → work → stop)
- one induced failure + the system’s response
- a quick metric or timing baseline

## Notes from the original roadmap
(No extra notes provided in the original file for this quest.)
